* p-search

  p-search is an Emacs tool to find things.  It combines concepts from
  information retrievial and Bayesian search theory to assist a user
  in finding documents.

  Boolean searches (i.e. the document contains the word "X"), while
  simple and useful, ofthen don't match the prior beliefs of the
  searcher concerning where the relevant files are.  Often times the
  searcher has specific ideas as to where the document is located.
  Like what type of file it is, who authored the document, when the
  document was created.  The searcher often times isn't fully
  confident as to how the seach terms appear or whether they appear at
  all.

  p-search provides a framework to coherently combine all this data to
  rank documents and to revise the rankings as the user searches
  through documents.

  This project is still a work in progress.  When you see
  documentation here, it means that the package is ready to be used.
